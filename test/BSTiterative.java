	/*
		Binary Search Tree (Iterative)
		Key properties: - left subtree is always lesser than the parent
						- right subtree is always greater than the parent
						- no duplicate nodes

		Iterative Insertion:    - 1. Compare the node you want to insert with root
								- 2. If it is greater than the root, go to the right subtree
								- 3. If it is lesser than the root, go to the left subtree
								- 4. Compare to the root of the subtree and repeat steps 2,3,1
								- 5. Insert
